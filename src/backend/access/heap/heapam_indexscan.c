 * off of cached visibility info that indicates that the dead TIDs are NOT
 * all-visible.
 *
 * What about the opposite case, where a page was all-visible when we cached
 * the VM bits but tuples on it are deleted afterwards?  That is safe too: any
 * tuple that was visible to all when we read the VM must also be visible to
 * our MVCC snapshot, so it is correct to skip the heap fetch for those TIDs.
