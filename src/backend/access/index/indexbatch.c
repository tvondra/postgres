 *
 * indexbatch.c
 *	  Batch-based index scan infrastructure for the amgetbatch interface.
 *
 * This module provides the core infrastructure for batch-based index scans,
 * which allow index AMs to return multiple matching TIDs per page in a single
 * call.  The batch ring buffer is owned by the table AM, typically maintained
 * alongside a read stream used for prefetching table blocks.
 *
 * The ring buffer loads batches in index key space/index scan order.  This
 * allows the table AM to maintain an adequate prefetch distance: its read
 * stream callback is thereby able to request table blocks referenced by index
 * pages that are well ahead of the current scan position's index page.
 *
 * There's three types of functions in this module:
 *
 * 1. Core batch scan lifecycle (index_batchscan_*): Functions called by
 *    indexam.c to manage batch scan state.  Currently just initialization
 *    and the mark operation needed for merge joins.  (Restoring a mark is a
 *    more complicated process which requires modifying table AM opaque state,
 *    so the corresponding restore function is in category 2.)
 *
 * 2. Table AM utilities (tableam_util_*): Helper functions called by table
 *    AMs during amgetbatch index scans.  These manage the scan's positional
 *    state, and help with certain aspects of resource management.
 *
 * 3. Index AM utilities (indexam_util_*): Helper functions called by index
 *    AMs that implement the amgetbatch interface.  Helps index AM manage
 *    resources like memory, locks, and buffer pins.
 *
 * The table AM calls the table AM utility functions directly, and uses
 * scanPos/scanBatch and prefetchPos/prefetchBatch in a standardized way (see
 * heapam_indexscan.c for the reference implementation), while index AMs free
 * and unlock batches as described in indexam.sgml.
