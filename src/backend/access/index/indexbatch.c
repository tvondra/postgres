 *
 * indexbatch.c
 *	  Batch-based index scan infrastructure for the amgetbatch interface.
 *
 * This module provides the core infrastructure for batch-based index scans,
 * which allow index AMs to return multiple matching TIDs per page in a single
 * call.  The batch ring buffer is managed by the table AM, with help from us,
 * and with help from the ring buffer inline functions in relscan.h.  This
 * approach enables efficient prefetching of table AM blocks during ordered
 * index scans.
 *
 * The ring buffer loads batches in index key space order.  This allows the
 * table AM to maintain an adequate prefetch distance: its read stream
 * callback is thereby able to request table blocks referenced by index pages
 * that are well ahead of the current scan position's index page.
 *
 * There's three types of functions in this module:
 *
 * 1. Core batch scan lifecycle (index_batchscan_*): Functions that manage
 *    batch scan state including initialization, reset, cleanup, and the
 *    mark/restore operations needed for merge joins.  Called by indexam.c
 *    routines that manage index scans on behalf of the core executor.
 *
 * 2. Table AM utilities (tableam_util_*): Helper functions called by table
 *    AMs during amgetbatch index scans.  These handle cross-batch direction
 *    changes, recording dead items for a later call to amkillitemsbatch, and
 *    freeing batches when the table AM is done with them.
 *
 * 3. Index AM utilities (indexam_util_*): Helper functions called by index
 *    AMs that implement the amgetbatch interface.  These manage batch
 *    allocation, index page buffer lock release, and batch memory recycling.
 *
 * These three layers coordinate without explicit coupling: the core lifecycle
 * functions assume that table AMs use scanPos/scanBatch and prefetchPos/
 * prefetchBatch in a standardized way (see heapam_handler.c for the reference
 * implementation), while table AMs assume that index AMs free and unlock
 * batches according to the conventions established here.  See indexam.sgml
 * for the full specification of the amgetbatch/amkillitemsbatch contract.
 *
 * The table AM fully controls the read stream as its own private state.
 * When the scan direction changes, the table AM must immediately reset its
 * read stream and invalidate prefetchPos -- blocks already requested via
 * prefetchPos will no longer match what scanPos needs to return.
 *
 * Crossing a batch boundary in a new scan direction is a separate process,
 * handled here: table AMs are required to call tableam_util_batch_dirchange
 * to leave the scan's batch ring buffer in a consistent state.  The current
 * implementation handles this by simply discarding most batches.  The key
 * invariant is that all loaded batches must be in a consistent scan direction
 * order.  (During cross-batch direction changes, the current scanBatch will
 * have its IndexScanBatchData.dir flipped, but we have no provision for
 * keeping all other loaded batches.  It's not clear that it'd be useful to
 * hold onto them; the scan direction is unlikely to change back.)
