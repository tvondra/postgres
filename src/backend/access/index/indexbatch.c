 *
 * indexbatch.c
 *	  Batch-based index scan infrastructure for the amgetbatch interface.
 *
 * This module provides the core infrastructure for batch-based index scans,
 * which allow index AMs to return multiple matching TIDs per page in a single
 * call.  The batch ring buffer is managed by the table AM, with help from us,
 * and with help from the ring buffer inline functions in relscan.h.  This
 * approach enables efficient prefetching of table AM blocks during ordered
 * index scans.
 *
 * The ring buffer loads batches in index key space order.
 *
 * There's three types of functions in this module:
 *
 * 1. Core batch scan lifecycle (index_batchscan_*): Functions that manage
 *    batch scan state including initialization, reset, cleanup, and the
 *    mark/restore operations needed for merge joins.  Called by indexam.c
 *    routines that manage index scans on behalf of the core executor.
 *
 * 2. Table AM utilities (tableam_util_*): Helper functions called by table
 *    AMs during amgetbatch index scans.  These handle cross-batch direction
 *    changes, recording dead items for a later call to amkillitemsbatch,
 *    freeing batches when the table AM is done with them, and calling
 *    amunguardbatch to drop the TID recycling interlock (the guard that
 *    prevents VACUUM from recycling TIDs while a scan is in flight).
 *
 * 3. Index AM utilities (indexam_util_*): Helper functions called by index
 *    AMs that implement the amgetbatch interface.  These manage batch
 *    allocation, index page buffer lock release, and batch memory recycling.
