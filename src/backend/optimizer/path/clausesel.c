 *		ROUTINES TO COMPUTE SELECTIVITIES
 ****************************************************************************/

/*
 * clauselist_selectivity -
 *	  Compute the selectivity of an implicitly-ANDed list of boolean
 *	  expression clauses.  The list can be empty, in which case 1.0
 *	  must be returned.  List elements may be either RestrictInfos
 *	  or bare expression clauses --- the former is preferred since
 *	  it allows caching of results.
 *
 * See clause_selectivity() for the meaning of the additional parameters.
 *
 * Our basic approach is to take the product of the selectivities of the
 * subclauses.  However, that's only right if the subclauses have independent
 * probabilities, and in reality they are often NOT independent.  So,
 * we want to be smarter where we can.
 *
 * The first thing we try to do is applying multivariate statistics, in a way
 * that intends to minimize the overhead when there are no multivariate stats
 * on the relation. Thus we do several simple (and inexpensive) checks first,
 * to verify that suitable multivariate statistics exist.
 *
 * If we identify such multivariate statistics apply, we try to apply them.
 *
 * First we try to reduce the list of clauses by applying (soft) functional
 * dependencies, and then we try to estimate the selectivity of the reduced
 * list of clauses using the multivariate MCV list.
 *
 * Finally we remove the portion of clauses estimated using multivariate stats,
 * and process the rest of the clauses using the regular per-column stats.
 *
 * Currently, the only extra smarts we have is to recognize "range queries",
 * such as "x > 34 AND x < 42".  Clauses are recognized as possible range
 * query components if they are restriction opclauses whose operators have
 * scalarltsel() or scalargtsel() as their restriction selectivity estimator.
 * We pair up clauses of this form that refer to the same variable.  An
 * unpairable clause of this kind is simply multiplied into the selectivity
 * product in the normal way.  But when we find a pair, we know that the
 * selectivities represent the relative positions of the low and high bounds
 * within the column's range, so instead of figuring the selectivity as
 * hisel * losel, we can figure it as hisel + losel - 1.  (To visualize this,
 * see that hisel is the fraction of the range below the high bound, while
 * losel is the fraction above the low bound; so hisel can be interpreted
 * directly as a 0..1 value but we need to convert losel to 1-losel before
 * interpreting it as a value.  Then the available range is 1-losel to hisel.
 * However, this calculation double-excludes nulls, so really we need
 * hisel + losel + null_frac - 1.)
 *
 * If either selectivity is exactly DEFAULT_INEQ_SEL, we forget this equation
 * and instead use DEFAULT_RANGE_INEQ_SEL.  The same applies if the equation
 * yields an impossible (negative) result.
 *
 * A free side-effect is that we can recognize redundant inequalities such
 * as "x < 4 AND x < 5"; only the tighter constraint will be counted.
 *
 * Of course this is all very dependent on the behavior of
 * scalarltsel/scalargtsel; perhaps some day we can generalize the approach.

 *
 * TODO Clamp the selectivity by min of the per-clause selectivities (i.e. the

 *
 * TODO We may remember the lowest frequency in the MCV list, and then later use

 *      frequent item, it'd be in the MCV list). This might improve cases with
 *      low-detail histograms.
 *

 *          found in the MCV list,
 *
 * TODO When applying the clauses to the histogram/MCV list, we can do

 *      eliminate the buckets/items sooner (so we'll be able to skip

 * We're looking for statistics matching at least 2 attributes, referenced in

 * attributes.
 *
 * If there are multiple statistics referencing the same number of columns
 * (from the clauses), the one with less source columns (as listed in the
 * ADD STATISTICS when creating the statistics) wins. Else the first one wins.
 *
 * This is a very simple criteria, and has several weaknesses:
 *
 * (a) does not consider the accuracy of the statistics
 *
 *     If there are two histograms built on the same set of columns, but one
 *     has 100 buckets and the other one has 1000 buckets (thus likely
 *     providing better estimates), this is not currently considered.
 *
 * (b) does not consider the type of statistics
 *
 *     If there are three statistics - one containing just a MCV list, another
 *     one with just a histogram and a third one with both, we treat them equally.
 *
 * (c) does not consider the number of clauses
 *
 *     As explained, only the number of referenced attributes counts, so if
 *     there are multiple clauses on a single attribute, this still counts as
 *     a single attribute.
 *
 * (d) does not consider type of condition
 *
 *     Some clauses may work better with some statistics - for example equality
 *     clauses probably work better with MCV lists than with histograms. But
 *     IS [NOT] NULL conditions may often work better with histograms (thanks
 *     to NULL-buckets).
 *
 * So for example with five WHERE conditions
 *
 *     WHERE (a = 1) AND (b = 1) AND (c = 1) AND (d = 1) AND (e = 1)
 *
 * and statistics on (a,b), (a,b,e) and (a,b,c,d), the last one will be selected
 * as it references the most columns.
 *
 * Once we have selected the multivariate statistics, we split the list of
 * clauses into two parts - conditions that are compatible with the selected
 * stats, and conditions are estimated using simple statistics.
 *
 * From the example above, conditions
 *
 *     (a = 1) AND (b = 1) AND (c = 1) AND (d = 1)
 *
 * will be estimated using the multivariate statistics (a,b,c,d) while the last
 * condition (e = 1) will get estimated using the regular ones.
 *
 * There are various alternative selection criteria (e.g. counting conditions
 * instead of just referenced attributes), but eventually the best option should
 * be to combine multiple statistics. But that's much harder to do correctly.
 *
 * TODO Select multiple statistics and combine them when computing the estimate.
 *
 * TODO This will probably have to consider compatibility of clauses, because
 *      'dependencies' will probably work only with equality clauses.

 * the implied part of the dependency from the list.
 *
 * This only reduces equality clauses, and ignores all the other types. We might
 * extend it to handle IS NULL clause, in the future.
 *
 * We also assume the equality clauses are 'compatible'. For example we can't
 * identify when the clauses use a mismatching zip code and city name. In such
 * case the usual approach (product of selectivities) would produce a better
 * estimate, although mostly by chance.
 *
 * The implementation needs to be careful about cyclic dependencies, e.g. when

 *
 * at the same time, which means there's 1:1 relationship between te columns.
 * In this case we must not reduce clauses on both attributes at the same time.
 *
 * TODO Currently we only apply functional dependencies at the same level, but
 *      maybe we could transfer the clauses from upper levels to the subtrees?
 *      For example let's say we have (a->b) dependency, and condition
 *
 *          (a=1) AND (b=2 OR c=3)
 *
 *      Currently, we won't be able to perform any reduction, because we'll
 *      consider (a=1) and (b=2 OR c=3) independently. But maybe we could pass
 *      (a=1) into the other expression, and only check it against conditions
 *      of the functional dependencies?
 *
 *      In this case we'd end up with
 *
 *         (a=1)

 *      as we'd consider (b=2) implied thanks to the rule, rendering the whole
