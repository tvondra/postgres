/*
 * Data Structures:
 *		buffers live in a freelist and a lookup data structure.
 *
 *
 * Buffer Lookup:
 *		Two important notes.  First, the buffer has to be
 *		available for lookup BEFORE an IO begins.  Otherwise
 *		a second process trying to read the buffer will
 *		allocate its own copy and the buffer pool will
 *		become inconsistent.
 *
 * Buffer Replacement:
 *		see freelist.c.  A buffer cannot be replaced while in
 *		use either by data manager or during IO.
 *
 *
 * Synchronization/Locking:
 *
 * IO_IN_PROGRESS -- this is a flag in the buffer descriptor.
 *		It must be set when an IO is initiated and cleared at
 *		the end of the IO.  It is there to make sure that one
 *		process doesn't start to use a buffer while another is
 *		faulting it in.  see WaitIO and related routines.
 *
 * refcount --	Counts the number of processes holding pins on a buffer.
 *		A buffer is pinned during IO and immediately after a BufferAlloc().
 *		Pins must be released before end of transaction.  For efficiency the
 *		shared refcount isn't increased if an individual backend pins a buffer
 *		multiple times. Check the PrivateRefCount infrastructure in bufmgr.c.

 *
 * We expect shared buffers to be much larger than page size (at least on
 * system where NUMA is a relevant feature), so the number of "not located"
 * buffers should be a negligible fraction. This only affects pages between
