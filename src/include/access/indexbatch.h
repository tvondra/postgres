 * indexbatch.h
 *	  Batch-based index scan infrastructure for the amgetbatch interface.
 *
 * Provides functions used by table AMs to manage an index scan's positional
 * state (stored in IndexScanDesc.batchringbuf), and to manage underlying
 * resources such as memory and buffer pins.  Also provides various utility
 * functions used by index AMs for batch resource management.
 *
 * This module does not provide elementary operations for manipulating the
 * scan's ring buffer (e.g., for appending a batch).  Those are implemented as
 * inline functions defined beside IndexScanDesc and IndexScanBatch.
