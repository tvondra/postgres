 *   [index AM static opaque]  <- index AM area (batch_index_opaque_static),
 *                                mandatory fixed-size index page info
 *   [IndexScanBatchData]      <- batch pointer, returned by amgetbatch
 *   [items[maxitemsbatch]]
 *   [tuples workspace]        <- index tuple area (batch_tuples_workspace),
 *                                only used during index-only scans
 *
 * batch_base_offset combines the table AM opaque area and the static index AM
 * opaque area into a single offset from the batch pointer to the true
 * allocation base.  We pfree a batch by passing pfree a pointer returned by
 * index_scan_batch_base.  We rely on the assumption that batches have a fixed
 * layout for the duration of an index scan (batches are cached for reuse to
 * avoid palloc churn).
 *
 * The table AM accesses its opaque area (sized batch_table_opaque_size) using
 * the index_scan_batch_table_area shim accessor.  The table AM is permitted
 * to choose the layout of its opaque area as it sees fit (or to request no
 * area) based on requirements that remain fixed throughout the whole scan.
 * Bitmap scans never get a table AM opaque area, since the table AM isn't
 * directly involved (amgetbitmap routines can be implemented using batches,
 * though that's just to allow code sharing with the AM's amgetbatch routine).
 *
 * An index AM is required to provide a fixed-size opaque area.  This area is
 * sized MAXALIGN(sizeof(the AM's struct)), and is always known at compile
 * time.  Index AMs use index_scan_batch_index_opaque_static to access the
 * area.  Access to the area is cheap (a compile-time-constant subtraction),
 * but its size cannot vary from scan to scan.  Index AMs typically use this
 * area to store things like index page sibling link block numbers.
