 * Data about one batch of items returned by (and passed to) amgetbatch during

 *
 * Each batch allocation has the following memory layout:
 *
 *   [table AM opaque area]    <- allocation base, at -(batch_base_offset)
 *   [table AM per-item area]  <- supplemental flexible array per-item data
 *   [index AM dyn opaque]     <- optional, dynamically sized
 *   [index AM static opaque]  <- at -(batch_index_opaque_static)
 *   [IndexScanBatchData]      <- batch pointer, returned by amgetbatch
 *   [items[maxitemsbatch]]
 *   [currTuples workspace]    <- index AM stores index tuples here for
 *                                index-only scans (batch_tuples_workspace)
 *
 * batch_base_offset combines the table AM opaque area (its fixed-size header
 * plus its per-item area), the optional dynamic index AM opaque area, and the
 * static index AM opaque area into a single offset from the batch pointer to
 * the true allocation base.  The indexbatch.c utilities pfree a batch by
 * passing pfree a pointer returned by index_scan_batch_base.  We rely on the
 * assumption that batches have a fixed layout for the duration of an index
 * scan (batches are cached for reuse to avoid palloc churn).
 *
 * The table AM accesses its opaque area using the index_scan_batch_table_area
 * shim accessor.  The area is a single contiguous block: a fixed-size header
 * (sized batch_opaque_size, possibly zero) immediately followed by a per-item
 * area (sized maxitemsbatch * batch_per_item_size, which can also be zero).
 * This lets the table AM describe the whole area with a single C struct that
 * has a flexible array member for its per-item data.  The table AM's
 * table_index_fetch_begin callback is permitted to vary the layout of its
 * opaque area as it sees fit, often based on the requirements of one
 * particular scan (e.g., heapam index-only scans use it to cache visibility
 * information, whereas heapam requires no private area during plain scans).
 * Bitmap scans involving an amgetbitmap routine that finds it convenient to
 * reuse batch infrastructure internally never get a table AM opaque area.
 *
 * An index AM gets two opaque areas, both before the batch pointer, divided by
 * what is known when.  The mandatory static area (batch_index_opaque_static)
 * has a size known at compile time -- MAXALIGN(sizeof(the AM's struct)) -- and
 * is accessed via indexam_util_batch_get_amdata at that fixed offset.  This is
 * more efficient but less flexible than the table AM scheme: every index AM
 * uses the same generic fixed-size header.
 *
 * Index AMs can use a second, optional dynamically-sized private area
 * (batch_index_opaque_dyn) that sits just before the static area.  Its size
 * is chosen at scan start rather than at compile time.  It is accessed via
 * index_scan_batch_index_opaque_dyn.  This second area is generally only used
 * during scans where large amounts of supplemental metadata are required,
 * that cannot reasonably be allocated for every scan.  Typically, this is
 * granular information about the batch's items for use by the index AM's
 * amgettransform routine.  Index AMs cannot expect this space to be allocated
 * during bitmap index scans.
