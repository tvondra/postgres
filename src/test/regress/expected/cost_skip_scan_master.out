-- Multirange perf validation test variant with whack-a-doodle costing due to
-- the presence of a skip array on "b" combined with a fairly selective
-- predicate on both "a" and "c":
set client_min_messages=error;
drop table if exists cost_multirange_medcard;
reset client_min_messages;
create unlogged table cost_multirange_medcard(a int, b int, c int);
create index cost_multirange_medcard_idx on cost_multirange_medcard(a, b, c);
insert into cost_multirange_medcard select x % ( 100_000 / 300), x, x from generate_series(1, 100_000) x;
vacuum analyze cost_multirange_medcard;
-- Note: "where a = 42" alone would return 301 rows, with "c = 99609" it's only 1 row
-- Note: When I discovered this problematic costing, master costed it at ~7,
-- whereas the patch costed it at ~1037 -- this wild disparity in cost is the
-- bug here
