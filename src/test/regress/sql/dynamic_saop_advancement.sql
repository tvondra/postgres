-- Confusion about wraparound for high order column --
------------------------------------------------------

-- (September 13) This test case demonstrates the need to wraparound the
-- most significant column (which is "thousand" here) so that the scan will
-- terminate on the leftmost leaf page, without needlessly accessing further
-- leaf pages to the right.
--
-- This is surprisingly subtle, and seems like it's the only test case that'll
-- catch this.  Note that what I describe is independent of the issue covered
-- by the next test case (nonarray_equality_strategy_orderproc_required_both_stages)
-- which was all about not doing the required comparisons in both functions.
-- This is about __not__ resetting cur_elem to zero for the "thousand" array once
-- the scan gets past the last "thousand = 1" tuple.
--
-- (October 28) We want to not only get the expected number of buffer hits; we
-- also want to terminate the scan within even incrementally advancing the
-- array keys.  More concretely, it should look like this (and does, at the
-- time of writing):
--
-- (November 10): See also, must_wraparound_high_order_column_equality_nomatch
--
-- _bt_advance_array_keys, tuple: (thousand, tenthous)=(2, 2), 0x7ff88b087ea0   <-- first (2, *) tuple
--   numberOfKeys: 2
--  - sk_attno: 1, cur_elem 1/1, val: 1 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
--  - sk_attno: 2, cur_elem 9001/20500, val: 9001 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
--  + sk_attno: 1, cur_elem 1/1, val: 1 [NULLS LAST, ASC]              <--- No changes here
--  + sk_attno: 2, cur_elem 9001/20500, val: 9001 [NULLS LAST, ASC]    <--- Nor here
--  _bt_advance_array_keys: returns false
-- _bt_readpage final: (thousand, tenthous)=(2, 2), 0x7ff88b087ea0, from non-pivot offnum 22 TID (93,20) ended page and scan
-- _bt_readpage stats: currPos.firstItem: 0, currPos.lastItem: 19, nmatching: 20 ✅

-- Provides backwards scan "We're still setting the keys to values >= the

--
-- This hits "hundred" column with tuple "(two, four, twenty, hundred)=(0, 0, 16, 96)".
-- This tuple is the first tuple seen by the first _bt_readpage call (its
-- offnum actually came from _bt_first's _bt_binsrch call).
--
-- Seems like this needs to make sure that we reset the cur_elem for "hundred"
-- to the first element for the current scan direction.  So this transition is
-- important:
--
-- - sk_attno: 1, cur_elem 0/0, val: 0 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
-- - sk_attno: 2, cur_elem 1/1, val: 1 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
-- - sk_attno: 3, cur_elem 0/0, val: 15 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
-- - sk_attno: 4, cur_elem 1/1, val: 1000 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
--
-- + sk_attno: 1, cur_elem 0/0, val: 0 [NULLS LAST, ASC]
-- + sk_attno: 2, cur_elem 0/1, val: 0 [NULLS LAST, ASC]    <-- advances (from 1 to 0), so we're "matching the tuple" now
-- + sk_attno: 3, cur_elem 0/0, val: 15 [NULLS LAST, ASC]   <-- now we're "ahead of the tuple", since its value for this is 16
--                                                              (though cannot advance array because it has only one element)
-- + sk_attno: 4, cur_elem 1/1, val: 1000 [NULLS LAST, ASC] <-- this one had better remain at the first element for scan direction
--                                                              (and not spuriously "advance" to 96 value from tuple/array, for example)
--
-- Not completely clear whether or not the handling for this case is strictly
-- necessary.  After all, sk_attno 4/"hundred" doesn't actually need to
-- change at all here.  Still seems practically mandatory to have this
-- handling, since it is likely almost impossible to prove this either way.
-- (Besides, we definitely need similar logic for forwards scans already, and having symmetry is no bad thing).
--
-- (February 4) UPDATE: Actually, next test case (written today) decisively
-- proves that proper symmetric handling of this case during backward scans is
-- strictly necessary (as suspected all along).

-- Don't accidentally scan way too many leaf pages rather than re-descend tree --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- UPDATE: (October 21) This variant of redescend_test was discovered by random chance
-- when you stressed the implementation by varying BTREE_DEFAULT_FILLFACTOR.
--
-- Apparently wraparound during backwards scans results in buggy
-- behavior/confusion when the scan direction changes.
--
-- UPDATE: (October 28) This bug was related to wraparound from incremental
-- advancement of array keys.  Recall that every form of what you could call array
-- wraparound (including during incremental advancement of array keys) has
-- since been removed.
--
-- UPDATE: (November 5) Recall that you originally had a separate test case
-- that minimally reproduced the wraparound bug by duplicating the start of
-- this test, but with fillfactor=30.  Today you decided to remove the smaller
-- test, and just use fillfactor=30 here, for the full test suite.
--
-- This decision was based on the fact that one of the later fetches from
-- cursor would fail a newly added assertion verifying agreement between input and
-- output scan keys, which wouldn't have been caught had I not randomly
-- decided to recheck what happened when I once again lowered fillfactor for
-- this test.  (The other factor that led to changing the tests like this was
-- the total lack of evidence that having independent coverage for default
-- fillfactor=90 had any independent benefit.  Plus it saved test cycles.)

-- This is the one case where a scan key required in the same direction as the
-- scan actually influences initial positioning strategy (usually it's only
-- equality strategy scan keys and required-in-opposite-direction-only
-- inequalities that can do that).  This is related to how _bt_check_compares
-- has that one case with NULLs that sees required-in-opposite-direction-only
-- cases passed as the sktrig to _bt_advance_array_keys.
--
-- The central feature of both of these optimizations is that the requiredness
-- of an inequality doesn't affect our continuescan-setting behavior with NULLs.
-- All that matters is the current scan direction, and the relationship
-- between that direction and whether NULLs are stored first or last relative
-- to non-NULLs


-- Same isn't true with this variant of the original query, that's also a
-- backwards scan, but has the operators flipped -- now the query has the same
-- adversarial character as the original (relative to the scan direction)

-- that see _bt_check_compare trigger continuescan=false due to the NULL
-- special case get treated rather like any other case where _bt_check_compare
-- sets continuescan=false upon encountering a required scan key -- namely, we
-- now do "beyond_end_advance" advancement in the style of other non-array required
-- scan keys.
--
-- This created a new problem (regressing older tests), though: it made
-- earlier and longer established required-in-opposite-direction-only cases
-- start to scan way too many pages again.  So fix had to do a special
-- sktrig-opposite-dir test that considers starting a new primitive index scan
-- if finaltup is still < new array keys (according to _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys,
-- at least).

--
-- XXX Incorrect commentary:
--
-- Note: (July 18) I initially overlooked a regression here, where backwards
-- scans would senselessly fail to skip several leaf pages (remember, it was
-- after I added emojis to debug log to make it easier to grasp the high level
-- structure with lots of output?).
--
-- I guess it's easier to overlook backwards scan issues, since you can't just
-- force a bitmap index scan to get index breakdown in EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
--
-- Note: (July 18) This is also an example of speculatively accessing the next
-- page during a backwards scan, while dealing with uncertainty about what's
-- on the next page.  Here we find some matches on the initial page we descend
-- onto, which encourages us to access its left sibling page -- which doesn't
-- work out.  If we didn't make this gamble then we'd only have 8 buffer
-- accesses instead of 9.  But it's an intelligent gamble that usually works
-- out (and works out in other test cases), so I say that this is worth it --
-- a bad speculation, but the cost of doing business.
--
-- XXX correction:
--
-- Update: (September 12) Well, that previous commentary was all wrong, and
-- likely written on autopilot just before leaving for NYC (the fact that this
-- was before I came up with the idea of using unlogged tables for better
-- insights into index page accesses in EXPLAIN ANALYZE output wouldn't have
-- helped, either).
--
-- In reality, this index should do 2 descents for two leaf pages, for a total
-- of 4 buffer accesses to the index itself, and 5 total (assuming one VM hit).
--
-- Update: (November 1) Recall that this test case went on to cause further
-- confusion in late October.  Today you figured out that this was really an
-- issue with _bt_binsrch_array_skey() not doing the right thing for backwards
-- scans, in that the progress of array key advancement wouldn't ratchet in
-- the scan direction (i.e. it was unlike forward scans once you actually
-- instrumented the binary searches themselves, even for the very simplest
-- cases with one page and two constants).

-- that I'd missed this earlier.
--
-- Here we have to visit leaf pages 7 and 8 (plus the root) because (since

-- Main, original "scankey_confusion" test:
--
-- Try to make the implementation confused about same-direction-required IS NOT NULL inequality
--
-- (September 7) XXX:  This gets 3 buffer hits, instead of 2, as before
-- binary search on tuple stuff was in.  I think that that might be due to the
-- fact that one of the search-type scan keys isn't required by the scan.
-- We can maybe do better here, but let's not worry about it just yet.
--
-- (September 11) XXX: Yeah, I think that that's all it is.  It's probably an
-- example of a more general problem, though.  I think that any combination of
-- a inequality strategy scan key that's required.  So anything that looks
-- roughly like this + a high key comparison could be a problem
-- (SK_SEARCHNOTNULL is not relevant, SK_BT_REQFWD-only + high key is relevant):
--
-- _bt_preprocess_keys: output inkeys[1]: [ flags: [SK_ISNULL, SK_SEARCHNOTNULL, SK_BT_REQFWD]
--
-- Basically this happens because the second call to _bt_check_compare() is
-- (somewhat suspiciously) not allowed to set continuescan=false, no matter
-- what, in the case where _bt_advance_array_keys_locally() said that the
-- tuple has keys that equal all of the corresponding current array elements.
--
-- What's so special about BTEqualStrategyNumber, anyway? The only special
-- thing about them is the need to suppress continuescan=false when we're
-- too early (per _bt_first and _bt_checkkeys/_bt_check_compare comments).
--
-- (September 14) UPDATE: Yeah, this is now fixed once again -- now we go back
-- to not being confused about inequalities.  Recall that this happened when
-- you figured out (or more like stumbled upon) a way to not have to veto what the
-- second call to _bt_check_compare says about "continuescan" -- the call at
-- the end of _bt_checkkeys (after _bt_checkkeys has found matching equality/array
-- keys, leaving only the possibility of continuescan=false being set due to
-- required inequality type keys).
--
-- XXX UPDATE: (November 11) Actually, this was wrong.  I think that I do need
-- to suppress continuescan=false set by the second call to _bt_check_compare
-- after all.  See "don't accept continuescan=false during second call to
-- _bt_check_compare" bug test case, below.
--
-- XXX UPDATE: (November 16) Actually, the original idea (that we only need
-- two buffer hits for this original query) was correct, but became conflated
-- with the aforementioned correctness issue of November 11.
--
-- Here's whats really going on here: we need to make _bt_advance_array_keys
-- call itself recursively to deal with a tuple that has two required scan
-- keys that become unsatisfied at the same time: the array on "a", and the
-- inequality on "b" (IS NOT NULL is required in only one direction, sort of
-- like 'WHERE b < NULL").  If we don't realize that it's both at the same
-- time during within the same tuple/call, we won't notice the second
-- inequality right away.
--
-- AFAICT allowing this really wouldn't be harmful, but it would mean that
-- this case would only terminate having read both of the leaf pages (leftmost
-- and rightmost leaf pages).  More importantly, not handling this precisely
-- would add an awkward caveat to the promise that _bt_advance_array_keys
-- makes about advancing the array keys to the maximum extent that's known to
-- be possible based on the scan's current tuple.  The recursive call thing is
-- kinda ugly, but right now I judge that it's less ugly than not having it.
--
-- Note: Here the recursive call to _bt_advance_array_keys happens on tuple:
-- (a, b)=(0, null)
--
-- XXX UPDATE (February 18): See also, related test case
-- equal_inequal_nonrequired, which is a more complicated scenario involving

-- (February 18)
--
-- Don't get confused with a mix of equality, inequality, and non-required
-- array -- this is a fancy version of scankey_confusion inequality.
--
-- This is another more complicated scenario involving
-- the recusive call to _bt_advance_array_keys.  It tests one aspect of the
-- logic becoming confused in the presence of a mix of required equality, required
-- inequality, and non-required array equality -- specifically, when they all
-- happen to change within one single call to _bt_advance_array_keys, for one
-- tuple only.

-- Bitmap index scan:
set enable_bitmapscan to on;
set enable_indexonlyscan to off;
set enable_indexscan to off;

set client_min_messages=error;
drop table if exists equal_inequal_nonrequired;
reset client_min_messages;

-- Index has to have very wide tuples, to make it easy to defeat suffix
-- truncation:
create unlogged table equal_inequal_nonrequired(equal int4, inequal int4, nonrequired int4, filler text);
alter table plain_equal_inequal_nonrequired set (autovacuum_enabled=off);
alter table equal_inequal_nonrequired alter column filler set storage plain;
create index plain_equal_inequal_nonrequired on equal_inequal_nonrequired(equal, inequal, nonrequired, filler);

-- Make sure storage of index is as expected (no TOAST compression):
select attrelid::regclass, attname, atttypid, attstorage
from pg_attribute
where attrelid::regclass::text = 'plain_equal_inequal_nonrequired';

-- Bulk insert:
insert into equal_inequal_nonrequired
select
  42,
  i % 5,
  i,
  repeat(chr(ascii('0')), 2500)
from
  generate_series(1, 20) i;

-- Now delete a much smaller tuple (no filler) that's going to be the one the
-- query returns from end of first page (page at blkno 1):
insert into equal_inequal_nonrequired
select
  41,
  -1,

-- Delete other tuples in blkno 1:

-- The fix for this issue involved making sure that _bt_advance_array_keys
-- didn't skip its recheck of the tuple (meaning its call to _bt_check_compare)
-- due only to an unsatisfied non-required array key that it detected
-- (detected by not finding a matching array element for that non-required
-- scan key array).
--
-- The buggy case involved:
--
-- 1. Needing to call _bt_advance_array_keys to advance the required array on
--    "equal" att.  Finding a match (advancing the array) for "equal" happens
--    while finding an exact match.
-- 2. Skipping over the required inequality on "inequal" att.
-- 3. Needing to find a match for non-required array scan key for
--    "nonrequired" att.  Finding a match for "nonrequired" fails.
--
-- This sets us up for trouble, because buggy code thought that the recheck
-- call to _bt_check_compare wasn't necessary due to point 3 above.  That
-- meant that there was no possible way that we could detect point 2 above in
-- second pass over tuple (with recursive call to _bt_advance_array_keys).
--
-- How can there be a second pass over the tuple if there is no second call to
-- _bt_check_compare that allows us to notice the inequality missed in
-- _bt_checkkeys's original (pre-_bt_advance_array_keys) call to
-- _bt_check_compare?  Point 2 can only be detected by seeing the second call
-- to _bt_check_compare set continuescan=false, and working backwards from that.

-- (February 25)

-- This test case is concerned with not confusing Korotkov's continuescan
-- precheck mechanism when we gamble and assume that -inf truncated attributes suggest
-- matches on the very next page.  (See also: next test case, keys_ahead test.)

-- keys_ahead test case --
--------------------------

--
-- (February 25)
--
-- This test case is concerned with not failing to cut our losses on the very
-- next page when we gamble and assume that -inf truncated attributes suggest
-- matches on the very next page.
--
-- When we get to the very next page and see that we guessed wrong, we must
-- cut our losses at that point -- we mustn't vainly plow on through other
-- leaf pages that come after that one.

set client_min_messages=error;
drop table if exists keys_ahead;
reset client_min_messages;
create unlogged table keys_ahead(a int4, b int4);
-- "Fillfactor 50" to make sure we get a truncated high key "(a, b)=(2)"
create index keys_ahead_idx on keys_ahead (a, b) with (fillfactor=50);
insert into keys_ahead
select i, j
  from generate_series(1, 2) i, generate_series(1, 2000) j
-- "order by hashint4(j)" to make sure we get a truncated high key "(a, b)=(2)"
order by hashint4(j);
vacuum analyze keys_ahead;

-- Now index looks like this:

-- Setup:
set client_min_messages=error;
drop table if exists btfirst_array_confusion_test;
reset client_min_messages;
create unlogged table btfirst_array_confusion_test(
  district int4,
  warehouse int4,
  orderid int4,
  orderline int4
);
create index btfirst_array_confusion_test_idx
            on
            btfirst_array_confusion_test(district, warehouse, orderid, orderline) with (fillfactor = 30);

-- Load:
insert into btfirst_array_confusion_test
select district, warehouse, orderid, orderline
from
  generate_series(1, 2) district,
  generate_series(1, 5) warehouse,
  generate_series(1, 10) orderid,
  generate_series(1, 10) orderline
order by
district, warehouse, orderid, orderline;

-- This is :rootitems, just to avoid test regressions:
select itemoffset, ctid, itemlen, nulls from bt_page_items('btfirst_array_confusion_test_idx',
  (select fastroot::int4 from bt_metap('btfirst_array_confusion_test_idx')));

-- Importantly, this test case involves cursor scrolling confined to this leaf
-- page (once bug is fixed this is what we expect):
--
-- 	_bt_readpage: 🍀  1 with 101 offsets/tuples (leftsib 0, rightsib 2) ➡️
--	 _bt_readpage first: (district, warehouse, orderid, orderline)=(1, 1, 9, 1), TID='(0,81)', 0x7f91ea04b848, from non-pivot offnum 82 started page
--	 _bt_advance_array_keys, sktrig: 2, tuple: (district, warehouse, orderid, orderline)=(1, 1, 10, 1), 0x7f91ea04b758

-- Index scan without materialization for cursor query:
set enable_seqscan to off;
set enable_bitmapscan to off;
set enable_indexonlyscan to off;
set enable_indexscan to on;
set work_mem = 64;
set enable_sort = off;

begin;
declare btfirst_array_confusion_test_cursor cursor for
select * from btfirst_array_confusion_test
where district in (1, 2) and warehouse = 1 and orderid = 9
order by district, warehouse, orderid, orderline;

-- Fetch all 10 orderlines for the first order returned by cursor, so that we
-- read all relevant index tuples from the first leaf page read, and so leave
-- so->currPos.itemIndex right at the end of the page (not one before or one after the
-- end; precisely at the boundaries between two adjoining pages):
fetch forward 10 from btfirst_array_confusion_test_cursor;

-- Fetch 9 orderlines before the last one returned by previous fetch
-- (_bt_first confusion happens here when run against buggy server, as
-- evidenced by this statement returning 10 rows rather than just 9):
fetch backward 10 from btfirst_array_confusion_test_cursor; -- returns an extra row with bug

-- Note: _bt_first becoming confused by the prior fetch statement relies on
-- the fact that the page we almost (but didn't quite) move right from is also
-- the first page visited by the entire top-level index scan for the cursor.
-- This is a necessary condition, since we don't try to call _bt_first again
-- when the scan direction changes unless the scan direction changes on the
-- first page for the top-level scan.

-- Repeat the first fetch, expect the same 10 order + orderline rows as with
-- the first fetch (but don't get them with buggy server with confused array
-- state following previous fetch):
fetch forward 10 from btfirst_array_confusion_test_cursor; -- returns no rows with bug

-- (December 18, 2024)
--
-- This revealed a bug on HEAD, where so->scanBehind wasn't reset on an
-- !sktrigrequired call to _bt_advance_array_keys, meaning that we denied
-- the _bt_check_compare recheck call the opportunity to return 'true'.
