--
-- (July 31) This test showed an issue with repeat leaf page accesses, which
-- became evident when I enabled the relevant BMS based instrumentation.
--
-- Ultimate fix for this bug was to teach _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys to call
-- _bt_binsrch_skiparray_skey for -inf scan keys, as a substitute for the
-- call to _bt_compare_array_skey performed when current array element is set
-- in search-type scan key (the call that wasn't and couldn't be made when
-- scan key is marked SK_BT_NEG_INF).
--
-- First leaf page repeatedly accessed was one of Blocknumber 1535, shown
