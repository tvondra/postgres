-- UUID tests --
----------------

-- (June 5)
--
-- UUID is notable for being a pass-by-reference type that can use the
-- increment/decrement stuff in roughly the same way as types like integer and
-- date.  It's a good way of making things like memory management and copying
-- of datums work, because I can do that stuff without first figuring out how
-- to do next value probes that are expected to be required by more popular
-- pass-by-reference types such as text.
--
-- Another notable thing about UUID is that it's unlikely that rolling over and
-- incrementing the existing UUID value will result in a UUID value that
-- actually finds a match in the index -- that makes it a lot closer to types
-- like text than to discrete types like integer.  With types like integer,
-- we somewhat expect that incrementing/decrementing the current value will
-- actually result in a value that finds matches in the index.
